All the fields should be delimited by double quotes " .

Target ressource definition still bugs when using simples target like "ressource", it only works with complex ones like "ressource.id".

To avoid this problem, change 'ressource' to 'ressource.', and everything will be fine.

- All the "value == value" should be either numerical or strings or bools.

- comparing an attribute to another attribute is not permitted.

on deny {
   advice ObligationAdvice.reasonForDeny { 
   Attributes.message = "There is no care relation"
} 

Doesnt recognize the "There is no care relation" as a string... God knows why.

Target clause Problems :

		* 1- This translator doesnt make the difference between 'and' and 'or' blocks, it gathers them in a struct regardless of their type.
		*
		* 2 - incomplete target clause definitions like : target clause , 
		*	will result in an empty 'require()' solidity block.

the parenthesis opening and closing mechanism might not be precise in some cases.

The attributes definition should be inside of the main namespace and not independent in the beginning/end of file.

All the attributes definitions should be in the same namespace; if not they will result in multiple constructors of the contract.

###########
empty target clause definition and empty conditions will result in an empty 'require ()' block in the output solidity code.

###########
The solidity language does not access the variables to have a '.' in their names. For example : 'ressoruce.owner'  wont be accepted by solidity compiler.
